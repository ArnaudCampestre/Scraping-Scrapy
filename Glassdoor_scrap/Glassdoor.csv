Basically they would rather no staff or have to find new staff instead of allowing current staff some leeway or flexibility.
We did a lot of work with minimal breaks for not even the London living wage, consiering that all main Benugo branches are in Central London. 
Management is usually not very organised themselves. 
When using any staff discounts, they seem very annoyed, as if you are all not part of the same workforce and putting in lots of energy into the job and don't deserve a break, even though we are entitled to it.
I was also told I could not move up in position because despite recommendation from other colleagues, the main boss didn't want to promote me because he said I was too 'outspoken', as if that's a bad thing. 
I started at 20 hours a week and was eventually pressured into increasing it to 30 hours, despite also being a full time student, because everyone kept quitting because working here is not the best and they couldn't find enough new people to replace them."

Manager/supervisors that discriminate you in front of other team members. 

They also think that by talking to you in a disrespectful way and by demanding things they will get more out of you. Where is the training Benugo? I mean, anyone with common sense wouldn’t do this but you are just losing out on potential good employees by letting bad management stay and make people’s life’s miserable. 

Never received proper coffee training, on my coffee day training I was shown the machine and told to check on YouTube if I wanted to learn, first time that I haven’t received training on-site and that I’ve been told to do trainings outside working hours.

Would ask us to do jobs after clocking out and if refused then you would just get stuck doing the worst jobs that nobody wanted to do or the same job every day when there is plenty of different roles.

Gave management a copy of my holidays for the year as it was all planned and every time I went on holiday they managed to give me more time off or forget to add me to the rota. 

Asked us to not wear jeans or trainers but even supervisors/managers would. 

No tips, they somehow always disappeared. Even though they said that they were going to be used for a staff night out that day never arrived. 

Shirts promised and they even asked everyone for sizes but never ordered/received.

Events supervisors clueless, could go on for a whole shift without a break and if you didn’t complaint you wouldn’t get it.  

Things required for work would break and never get repaired.

Kitchen would always stink and look dirty, would never eat there even if they paid me. Talking about food, everyone that ate Benugo’s food would constantly get sick and/or a sore stomach. 

Lots of very hard working people at the same time as lots of very NOT hard working people, no teamwork which makes you feel like you are better off not working hard because why work hard in a company that when you are 1 or 2 people down and you work harder than ever they don’t even smile or say goodbye or good morning to you. 

I am more than happy to not be working here anymore and would not care if I have to live under a bridge as long as I don’t have to see and experience my colleagues and myself being treated like rubbish day after day."

This company looks appealing from the outside but once you start working for them you will see the just how badly the company is managed. I worked for Benugo in the National Museum of Scotland and Urquhart Castle from 2014-2017. The managers are rude, disrespectful, backstabbing and all they care about is getting their bonus. The managers refer to the staff as ‘Assets’ and will put on a fake smile to make you work hard. In my 4-year experience with Benugo I can say with confidence that the cafes are always severely understaffed (simply because the manager only cares about the hefty bonus she will get if the labour costs are reduced), which means that the staff must rush around and work twice as hard. The staff are forced to do 5 tasks at once means that the customer service is awful. The customers get treated poorly because of chronic understaffing, they pay over £3 for a rushed, sour coffee that is made by a manager who is paranoid about getting her end-of-the-month bonus. The manager will never take on any criticism from customers and staff alike. For example, if a customer complains about the food, it’s the customers fault. The management will always have an excuse to why they won’t employ more people. The poor customers pay a fortune for stale scones and bitter Coffee. This mess of a company is a direct result of UNDERSTAFFING which is something the company and managers do not seem to understand. The managers are never happy and blame everything on the staff."

- illogical decisions by undertrained/inexperienced people who were prematurerly promoted to be decision-makers

Met loads of amazing people, but some that shouldn't be working in catering because its not for them at all therefore making others lives  very difficult by doing their job too.
Not enough advertisement or No advertising is blamed on staff if not out and handing flyers to people so they can discover quite often the hidden gems. If there isn't enough staff on floor you can't afford to do this. And you can't force anyone to be on streets and bother people whiles trying to get home asap.
Some managers are working till they drop, sometimes 28h a day and still getting checked on by people from ""above "" and some managers are favoured so they can work from 11am till 5pm and of course with weekends off. And of course no one checks on them...Leaving team leaders in charge who often don't get paid well for what they are doing for the company.
You are being recognised by hard working very early, and given promises of being promoted and getting pay rise , but when its not happening of course you will ask what's happening which isnt a good thing as it all can turn around by saying: ""you should be grateful that you can work here! Because if we wouldn't know you, you won't be considered anymore to be given this opportunity "" 
So good advice, just shut up!"
